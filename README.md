# Pro.gitignoreCCS
  A gitignore file for your projects from Code Composer Studio. You must place this file
in your CCS workspace. The folder that CCS says where your workspace is, if you put it in
another carpet although it will be inside of your workspace will not work, in this case you 
must change the file's name(correct their local directory). The first lines will ignore the 
workspace's temporary filesand configurations for the PC. The rest of them will ignore all 
files that CCS updateeach time we recompile or change settings in our program. This files 
should not be usedin other PC becouse they could generate errors. If you have several projects 
in the sameworkspace you must copy the lines that contain <YourProjectName> and paste them in 
the document with the other project's name. 

Note: REMEMBER TO CHANGE <YourProjectName> in the file and type your project's name...

I hope this file could help you all with your CCS project's :)
